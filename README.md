# Robust Arduino Serial Protocol in Rust

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/araffin/rust-arduino-serial.svg?branch=master)

`robust_arduino_serial` is a simple and robust serial communication protocol. It was designed to make two arduinos communicate, but can also be useful when you want a computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) to communicate with an Arduino.
